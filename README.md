# KPA-Flow

This project provides the source code for '[**Learning Optical Flow with Kernel Patch Attention**]()'. (CVPR-2022)

## Overview

We propose a novel approach, called kernel patch attention (KPA), to better resolve ambiguity in dense matching by explicitly taking the local context relations into consideration. Our KPA operates on each local patch, and learns to mine the context affinities for better inferring the flow fields. It can be plugged into contemporary optical flow architecture and empower the model to conduct comprehensive motion analysis with both feature similarities and spatial relations.
